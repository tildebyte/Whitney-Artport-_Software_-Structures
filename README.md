# [Whitney Artport {Software} Structures](https://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures2016)
[Casey Rea's](http://reas.com) (et al. [1]) work for a 2004 commission from the [Artport](http://artport.whitney.org) ("the Whitney Museum's portal to net art and digital arts, and an online gallery space for commissioned net art projects"), which was (fortunately!) updated and restored in 2016.

Only the "#003" structure is represented here.

This repo is to house a port to [Processing.py](http://py.processing.org), for pedagogic purposes.
